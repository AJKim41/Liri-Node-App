# Liri-Node-App

Homework #10

LIRI is like iPhone's SIRI. However, while SIRI is a Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface, LIRI is a Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI will be a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data.

What Each Command Should Do

1. node liri.js concert-this <artist/band name here>

This will search the Bands in Town Artist Events API and show information about the closest concert date.

2. node liri.js spotify-this-song '<song name here>'

This will show information about the song.

3. node liri.js movie-this '<movie name here>'

This will output information about the movie

4. node liri.js do-what-it-says

Using the fs Node package, LIRI will take the text inside of random.txt and then use it to call one of LIRI's commands.

all of this info is also saved into the userSearch.txt file.
